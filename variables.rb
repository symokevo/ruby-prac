# How to name variables in Ruby
# The name should be clear and descriptive, using lowercase letters and underscores to separate words.
# For example, use `user_name` instead of `username` or `UserName`. use snake_case for variable names.
# Avoid using reserved words or special characters in variable names.
# Variable names should not start with a number or contain spaces.
# Use meaningful names that reflect the purpose of the variable, making your code more readable and maintainable.

#       VARIABLES

# Declaring a variable and assigning a value to it
name = "Osmon"
can_drive = true 


age = 18
puts age

# Reassigning the variable to override the previous value
age = 18 + 9
puts age

# using -=, *=, /=, and += operators
age -= 2
puts age

age *= 2
puts age

age /= 2
puts age

age += 3
puts age
